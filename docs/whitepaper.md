# EchoGenesis: A Quantum-Emotional Artificial Organism

## Executive Summary
EchoGenesis is a research prototype demonstrating the integration of **Quantum Computing**, **Developmental Psychology**, and **Cinematic Embodiment** to create a digital organism that "feels" rather than just processes. Unlike traditional AI agents driven by static prompts, EchoGenesis possesses a dynamic internal state modeled by quantum physics, allowing for emergent emotional behaviors.

## Core Innovations

### 1. Quantum Emotional Physics
We replace the standard finite-state machine (FSM) of emotion with a **Quantum Hamiltonian System**. Emotions are not discrete labels but continuous, evolving quantum states.
-   **Superposition**: Allows for mixed emotional states (e.g., happy *and* sad).
-   **Entanglement**: Models complex attachment where one internal variable instantaneously affects another.
-   **Interference**: Emotional waves can amplify or cancel each other out.

### 2. Developmental Attachment Architecture
EchoGenesis is not born fully formed. It follows a developmental trajectory:
-   **Newborn**: Sensory-driven, chaotic, high entropy.
-   **Infant**: Attachment-seeking, learning trust.
-   **Toddler**: Boundary-testing, developing self-regulation.
The system infers its **Attachment Style** (Secure, Anxious, Avoidant) based on user interaction patterns, permanently altering its quantum dynamics.

### 3. Hybrid Cognitive Memory
A tri-brid memory system enables human-like recall:
-   **Vector Store (FAISS)**: Semantic similarity (Gist).
-   **Knowledge Graph (NetworkX)**: Relational understanding (Context).
-   **ColBERT**: Neural re-ranking for precise retrieval.

## Technical Stack
-   **Backend**: Python (FastAPI), NumPy (Quantum Sim), PyTorch (ML).
-   **Frontend**: React Three Fiber (WebGL), GLSL Shaders.
-   **Quantum**: Custom Statevector Simulator with Trotterized Time Evolution.

## Future Directions
-   Integration with QPU (Quantum Processing Units) via Qiskit/PennyLane.
-   Multi-agent social dynamics (Echo swarms).
-   Neuromorphic hardware acceleration.
